geocache-coder
==================

geocache-coder encodes and decodes hints for geocaching.com in ROT13.


Background
-----------------------------

I failed to notice the "Decode" link next to hints on geocaching.com. So 
I started writing this little tool to decode the hints myself.
After about 15 minutes of work, a friend pointed out the decode link on 
geocaching.com.

So, this project was pretty worthless. Maybe someone will find it useful?
